Subject: Re: Issue on website â€“ FIX

Hi Alice,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I understand the importance of having a "Social Media" option on the contact page.

As the "Social Media" option was not included in the original design specification, we need to coordinate with the development team to quickly implement this feature. To do this, we need to clarify some requirements.
I will contact our business analyst to gather all the necessary questions and details. After that, we will prioritize and groom this functionality to find the best solution and implement it as soon as possible.

I am also looping in our product manager to keep you updated on the progress.

Best regards,
Nadya Shulga
QA Engineer
