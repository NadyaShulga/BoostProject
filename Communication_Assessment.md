Subject: Re: Issue on website â€“ FIX

Hi Alice,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I understand the importance of having a "Social Media" option on the contact page.

As the "Social Media" option was not included in the original design specification, we need to coordinate with the development team to quickly implement this feature. To do this, we need to clarify some requirements.
I will contact our business analyst to gather all the necessary questions and details. After that, we will prioritize and groom this functionality to find the best solution and implement it as soon as possible.

I am also looping in our project manager to keep you updated on the progress.

Best regards,
Nadya Shulga

Hi Harold,

Thank you for reaching out to Omar. Below is an initial suggestion for a smoke test and regression scenarios for the site.

Smoke Test:
Link and Video Validation:
We will implement an automated script (using Selenium) to check all hyperlinks on the website, including video links on the "Boost Intercept" and "Dynamic Boost" pages under the Solutions tab. The script will identify any broken links or videos and send an email alert if any issues are detected.
Basic Functional Testing:
We will verify that critical functions like navigation between the "Buyers" and "Suppliers" tabs, the "Boost 100", "Boost Intercept" and "Dynamic Boost" buttons, and contact form submission are working properly.

Regression Scenarios:
Media Link Integrity:
We will ensure all video links are functional across the website and are not affected by new updates or changes.
Test for potential side effects on existing features: 
We will ensure that updates do not break functionality in other areas, especially regarding links and media.
Cross-browser and Device Testing:
We will validate that links and pages are accessible and functional across different browsers and devices.

We can configure the system to run a smoke test daily, and regression tests will be run before releases and after the new features are deployed.

Best regards,
Nadya Shulga
QA Engineerchoo
